# DiabetesClassifier_Capstone

### This is my capstone project in Applied Machine Learning as part of the Masters of Science in Data Science at Eastern University. For this project I set out to train a binary classifier to predict diabetes risk based upon self-reported risk factors. All data preprocessing and model training was performed in a Jupyter Notebook and then the model was deployed into a Flask web app. All project files as well as the initial data set used are included in this repository.
